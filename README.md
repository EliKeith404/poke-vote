## Things Learned 🔖

This is my very first TypeScript and MySQL project! Prisma is a very handy tool in making SQL queries and schemas straight-forward and easy. tRPC is used as my type-safe backend to smooth out the development process by enabling IntelliSense and making sure I'm handling all potential null values.

There were of course a lot of hiccups getting my typings correct, but the tools I used guided me to the right path. From this point on I'll use TypeScript by default, and potentially consider converting my other projects to it as well.
